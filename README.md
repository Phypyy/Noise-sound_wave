##How to be this!

I tried to transform song data file to shape and that is wave of sound. How to change shape? This is my question for challenge. 

 - I use process of Noise for change shape from line to points.
 So "noise(i/N, t)", N is numbers of point in the line of sound wave, at this you can change value. 

 - But I not have idea how to stretch FFT.
